Python & Libraries Quickstarter

This is a quickstart section, please read this document before proceeding with the next part.

The quickstart sections are about Python Libraries, which give you a head-start if you
want to start Machine Learning in less time. For more detailed introduction to libraries
see the respective sections of Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib etc. You can install
these libraries using pip. For example -
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib

If you are new to programming, then the sections starting from Python Basics are
recommended. You won't miss anything if you start from Python Basics (next Module)
and skip this one
